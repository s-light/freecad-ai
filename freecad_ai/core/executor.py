"""Code execution engine for FreeCAD AI.

Extracts Python code from LLM responses and executes them in FreeCAD's
interpreter with the appropriate modules in scope.

Safety layers:
  1. Static validation — block dangerous patterns
  2. Subprocess sandbox — test code in a headless FreeCAD process first
  3. Undo transactions — roll back failed operations
  4. Auto-save — save document before execution so crashes don't lose work
